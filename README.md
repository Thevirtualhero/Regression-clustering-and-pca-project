ðŸ’Ž Diamond Price Prediction and Market Segmentation Project
This repository documents a complete machine learning workflow on the comprehensive diamond dataset. The project involves data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction using PCA, unsupervised clustering for market segmentation, and building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for price prediction.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Preprocessing: Clean the raw data, handle categorical features, and standardize numerical features.

Dimensionality Reduction (PCA): Apply Principal Component Analysis for feature compression and visualization of diamond cut classes.

Market Segmentation (Clustering): Group diamonds into meaningful market segments using K-Means clustering.

Price Prediction (ANN Regression): Develop a highly accurate neural network model to predict the price of a diamond based on its physical characteristics.
